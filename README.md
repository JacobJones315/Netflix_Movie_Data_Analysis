# Exploring Trends in Netflix Movie Runtimes
* In this analysis, I delved into the world of Netflix movies to understand whether there's a discernible pattern in their durations over the years. Leveraging the power of Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn, I crafted a series of compelling visualizations, including line charts, bar chart, histogram, and scatterplots.

* The overarching conclusion derived from this deep dive into the data is indeed intriguing â€” there seems to be no substantial trend in the overall runtime of Netflix movies when considering the entirety of the streaming giant's library. A detailed examination through the lens of line charts and scatter plots, depicting movie durations by year, reveals a captivating absence of any clear upward or downward trajectory. This observation remains steadfast even after filtering out popular genres like dramas, action, documentaries, comedies, children's movies, and stand-up comedies, as highlighted by the scatter plot's data points.

* Nevertheless, when narrowing the focus to Netflix movies released post the advent of online streaming, a subtle shift comes to light. A gradual decline in movie duration since 2007 emerges, adding a nuanced layer to the evolution of Netflix's cinematic offerings. This revelation unfolds gracefully in the line chart provided, offering a glimpse into the changing landscape of movie durations within Netflix's post-streaming era.
