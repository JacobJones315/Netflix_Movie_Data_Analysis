# Exploring Trends in Netflix Movie Runtimes
* In this analysis, I delved into the world of Netflix movies to understand whether there's a discernible pattern in their durations over the years. Leveraging the power of Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn, I crafted a series of compelling visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, histograms, box plots, and scatterplots.

* The overarching conclusion drawn from the data is intriguing â€” there appears to be no significant trend in the runtime of Netflix movies when looked at the entirety of Netflix's library. A meticulous examination through line charts and scatter plots showcasing movie durations by year reveals a lack of any distinct upward or downward trajectory. This observation holds true even when filtering out popular genres such as dramas, action, documentaries, comedies, children's movies, and stand-up comedies, as indicated by the data points in the scatter plot.

* However, by narrowing the window to look at Netflix movies that released after the introduction of online streaming, there does appear to be a gradual decline in movie duration since 2007.
